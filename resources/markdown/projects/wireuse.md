## What is WireUse?

WireUse is a collection of helpful utilities for [Livewire V3](https://livewire.laravel.com/).

This package tries to rely on functionalities that both Livewire and Laravel already offer,
and offer useful features and utilities on top of that.

The goal is to be minimal, and to give you as a developer tools to build your own set of Livewire and Blade components.

## Can I combine WireUse with other packages?

It may be used as an package in your own projects, and on package development.

Special note on [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) as it implements a lot of own logic. This means some features of WireUse may not usable in Filament.
