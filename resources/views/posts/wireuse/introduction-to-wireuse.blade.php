## What is WireUse?

WireUse is a collection of helpful utilities for [Livewire V3](https://livewire.laravel.com/).

This package tries to rely on functionalities that both Livewire and Laravel already offer,
and offer useful features and utilities on top of that.

The goal is to be minimal, and to give you as a developer tools to build your own set of Livewire and Blade components.

## Can I combine WireUse with other packages?

In almost most cases, yes!<br>
It can be used as an extension in your own project, but also when developing packages.

Keep in mind packages like [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) implement their own route logic, set of utilities and components.<br>
This means some features of WireUse may not usable in Filament.
