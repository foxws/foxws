## Introduction

> See the following [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/livewire/livewire/discussions/2627) for more details.

By default the dehydrated value of model properties sent over Livewire might look something like this:

```json
{
    "type": "model",
    "class": "user",
    "key": 1,
    "relationships": []
}
```

When using our property synthesizers it tries to hide the model IDs, by forcing the model [route-key](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/routing#customizing-the-key) instead of the actual model `key`:

```json
{
    "type": "model",
    "class": "user",
    "key": "91e0df48-a06e-4376-b273-73d97de96352", // notice the UUID
    "relationships": []
}
```

## Usage

To use the property synthesizers, create a custom [Service Provider](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/providers#writing-service-providers):

```bash
php artisan make:provider LivewireServiceProvider
```

Adjust the `boot` method:

```php
use Foxws\WireUse\Support\Livewire\LegacyModels\EloquentCollectionSynth;
use Foxws\WireUse\Support\Livewire\LegacyModels\EloquentModelSynth;
use Foxws\WireUse\Support\Livewire\Models\CollectionSynth;
use Foxws\WireUse\Support\Livewire\Models\ModelSynth;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class LivewireServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot(): void
    {
        $this->configureSynthesizers();
    }

    protected function configureSynthesizers(): void
    {
        app('livewire')->propertySynthesizer([
            ModelSynth::class,
            CollectionSynth::class,
            EloquentModelSynth::class,
            EloquentCollectionSynth::class,
        ]);
    }
}
```

If you need to use model keys in your views, arrays and collections, it is recommended to use `$model->getRouteKey()` instead of `$model->getKey()` or `$model->id`.

Using [Enforcing Morph Maps](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties#properties-expose-system-information-to-the-browser) may also be useful to not expose the original class and it's namespace.

> Tip: Using a route-key is also useful on child components that need a `wire:key` or `key`.
