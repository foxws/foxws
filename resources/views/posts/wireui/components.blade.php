## Usage

WireUi offers a set of components that you can include on your [Component](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/blade#components).

Components can be included by prefixing with `x-wireui`:

@verbatim
```php
<div class="container">
    <x-wireui::actions-link
        target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/foxws/foxws"
    >
        Source
    </x-wireui::actions-link>
</div>
```
@endverbatim

Please checkout our [source-code](https://github.com/foxws/wireui/tree/3.x/src) for all available components.
