## What is WireUse?

WireUse is a collection of helpful utilities to Livewire V3.

The project tries to rely as much as possible on the functionalities that both Laravel and Livewire already offer,
and to offer useful features on top of that.

The goal is to be minimal, and to give you as a developer tools to build your own components.

## Can I combine WireUse with other packages?

In almost all cases, yes!<br>
It can be used as an extension in your own project, but also in your own packages.

## Who created WireUse?

WireUse was initially created by [Fran√ßois Menning](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoismenning/), a developer from the Netherlands.

## Why the name WireUse?

The package was originally going to be called LivewireUse.
To avoid trademark issues, and also to provide a shorter name, a friendly colleague [Amir Swaleh](https://github.com/Amiejah) came up with the name WireUse.
