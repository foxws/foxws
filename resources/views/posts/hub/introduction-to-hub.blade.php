## What is Hub?

Hub is a video on demand (VOD) media distribution system that allows users to access to videos, television shows and films.

This is a personal project, please do not expect a production ready product.
It is mainly intended for learning and testing Laravel features.

You can fork the project and make your own adjustments based on my changes.

## What feature stack does Hub use?

It uses the following stack:

- Laravel 11.x
- Livewire 3.x with latest [WireUse](https://foxws.lan/projects/wireuse)
- TailwindCSS 3.x
- AlpineJS
- Podman 5.1

For streaming, the [nginx-vod-module](https://github.com/kaltura/nginx-vod-module) is being used.

It is a very flexible nginx module, which can also be used to dynamically retrieve content of video and streaming.
